# belly-button-challenge

In this Challenge I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

I used the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.

Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

Used sample_values as the values for the bar chart.

Used otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.

Used otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.

Created a bubble chart that displays each sample.

Used otu_ids for the x values.

Used sample_values for the y values.

Used sample_values for the marker size.

Used otu_ids for the marker colors.

Used otu_labels for the text values

Displayed the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

Displayed each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

Updated all the plots when a new sample is selected. Also created layout for my dashboard
